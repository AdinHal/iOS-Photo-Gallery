# iOS-Photo-Gallery
A simple App created in Swift for browsing Your gallery. It uses CollectionView and is separated into 4 rows. The app is also based on the amount of images on the phone, the more images there are the better it is. So I recommend getting some images from unsplash.com to really test it out.
